# CBNT
This library was first developed to investigate the possibility of inferring code naturalness through CodeBERT predictions.
We continue using and adapting it to other research.

## Example usage:
This library has been implemented to conduct the study of naturalness captured by CodeBERT:

    @article{khanfir2022codebertnt,
        title={CodeBERT-nt: code naturalness via CodeBERT},
        author={Khanfir, Ahmed and Jimenez, Matthieu and Papadakis, Mike and Traon, Yves Le},
        journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.06042},
        year={2022}
    }

###Next Todos:
- documentation.
- testing.
- refactoring.

###Credits:
We invoke and exploit the predictions of CodeBERT: https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT
